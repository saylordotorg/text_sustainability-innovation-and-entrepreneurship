    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s03_p01">In the United States, the slow pace of government action on environmental protection during the 1980s began to change with the Superfund reauthorization in 1986. The following year, Congress overrode President Reagan’s veto to amend the Clean Water Act to control nonpoint sources of pollution such as fertilizer runoff.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_062">Philip Shabecoff, <em class="emphasis">A Fierce Green Fire: The American Environmental Movement</em> (New York: Hill &amp; Wang, 1993), 230.</span> As America’s economy continued to expand during the 1980s, so did its solid waste problem. The issues of America’s bulging landfills and throwaway economy were captured by the image of the Mobro 4000, a barge carrying 3,168 tons of trash that set sail from Islip, Long Island, New York, on March 22, 1987.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_063">William Rathje and Cullen Murphy, <em class="emphasis">Rubbish!</em> (New York: Harper Perennial, 1992), 28.</span> The barge spent the next fifty-five days in search of a suitable location to deposit its cargo while drawing significant media attention.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_064">Philip Shabecoff, <em class="emphasis">A Fierce Green Fire: The American Environmental Movement</em> (New York: Hill &amp; Wang, 1993), 271.</span> Meanwhile, New York City’s Fresh Kills Landfill became the largest landfill in the world. The following summer, the issue of waste returned to the headlines when garbage and medical waste, including hypodermic needles, began washing onto beaches in New York and New Jersey, costing coastal counties in New Jersey an estimated $100 million in tourist revenue. Public outcry spurred the federal government to ban ocean dumping of municipal waste. The states of New York and New Jersey subsequently closed several coastal sewage treatment plants, upgraded others, and enacted laws for medical waste disposal.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_065">Andrew J.

    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s03_p02">America’s reliance on fossil fuels was brought to the forefront once again when the <em class="emphasis">Exxon Valdez</em> supertanker ran aground in Prince William Sound, Alaska, on March 24, 1989. Over 10 million gallons of crude oil spilled from the ship, polluting 1,200 miles of coastline. Approximately 350,000 sea birds, several thousand rare otters, and countless other animals were killed. In 2010, lasting damage from the spill was still documented. The accident coincided with and helped to further a generational peak in environmental awareness.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s03_p03">Legal judgments against Exxon exceeded $5 billion, and the incident single-handedly led to the enactment of the Ocean Pollution Act of 1990, which mandated safety measures on ocean crude oil transport.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_066">Andrew J. Hoffman, <em class="emphasis">From Heresy to Dogma: An Institutional History of Corporate Environmentalism</em> (San Francisco: New Lexington Press, 1997), 121–22.</span> By the early 1990s, the chemical and energy industries were becoming increasingly proactive on environmental matters, looking beyond regulatory compliance toward crafting a specific environmental management strategy. The nature of government regulation began to change as well, with increasing emphasis on goals rather than technology-forcing to achieve those goals (e.g., the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990). This allowed industry more flexibility in selecting approaches to emissions reductions that made financial sense.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s03_p04">Improved regulatory design focused on goals and results rather than means and proscribed technical fixes, representing what many viewed as a positive policy strategy evolution. This adaptation by government occurred in part as a response to industry resistance to government imposition of “command and control” requirements. Often neglected in polarized discussions that simplistically frame business against government is the fact that governments are steadily adjusting, updating, and refining regulatory approaches to better reflect new knowledge, technology, and business realities. It should be kept in mind that the history of environmental and sustainability issues in business is an evolutionary process of constantly interacting and interdependent cross-sector participants that may collide but ultimately adapt and change. Just as the regulatory bodies have had to adapt to changing and emerging resource, waste stream, Earth system, and health problems, so too have environmental groups and companies had to acknowledge a novel cascade of problems associated with industrial production. Shifting, give-and-take, back-and-forth dynamics characterized the terrain even as new participants emerged. Examples of this evolution were the rising numbers of health, equity, energy, and environmental nongovernmental activist organizations, many of which had lost faith in governments’ capacities to solve problems. However, pressures on government by such groups might cause a regulatory response that creates an unintended new pollution problem. For example, does a focus on reducing large particulate matter in the air from vehicle emissions drive higher emissions of microsized particles that create a new set of medical challenges and respiratory afflictions? In addition, the environmental community is not monolithic. These organizations range from law-defying extreme activists attacking corporations to pragmatic, collaborative science-based nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) working closely with companies to generate solutions. Despite this rich evolutionary adaptive phenomenon across sectors, for the most part companies remained relatively resistant to environmental groups through the 1990s.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s03_p05">Compliance was still the primary goal, and companies combining forces to set industry standards became a method of forestalling regulation. Unless they were singled out due to their industry’s visibility or poor reputation, most companies continued to see health and environmental issues as a burden and additional cost. Environmentalism was associated with tree-huggers, altruists, overhead cost burdens, and public sector fines and regulation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s03_p06">As if on a parallel yet nonintersecting path, in 1989, a special issue of the <em class="emphasis">Scientific American</em> journal articulated the state of scientific understanding of the growing global collision and the urgency of addressing the clashes among human economic growth patterns, ecological limits, and population growth. For the first time, the need to address dominant policies and economic growth models was being raised in a leading US scientific journal.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s03_p07">In fact, debate on scientific evidence and necessary global action was expanding to challenge the one-dimensional view held by most corporate leaders. With the rise in environmental problems at the global scale, the United Nations (UN) convened a conference on the environment in Rio de Janeiro in June of 1992, which became known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Rio Earth Summit</a><span class="glossdef">A United Nations conference on the environment held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992.

Attending this unprecedented forum were more than 100 heads of state, representatives from 178 nations, and 18,000 people from 7,000 NGOs. Major results included a nonbinding charter for guiding environmental policies toward sustainable development, a nonbinding agreement on forestry management and protection, the establishment of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development, and conventions on climate change and biodiversity that have not yet been ratified by enough nations to go into effect. Despite the lack of binding treaties, the Rio Earth Summit succeeded in articulating general global environmental principles and guidelines in a consensus-driven setting involving participation by most of the world’s nations.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_067">Tyler Miller Jr., <em class="emphasis">Living in the Environment: Principles, Connections, and Solutions</em>, 9th ed. (Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 1996), 706.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s03_p08">While there may have been less activity in the United States at the time, a new era was under way internationally. Creation of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) marked a turning point in global business engagement. In preparation for the Rio Earth Summit, Swiss industrialist Stephan Schmidheiny organized the WBCSD in 1990. The council featured over fifty business leaders from around the world. Their task was without precedent, as Schmidheiny explained: “This is the first time that an important group of business leaders has looked at these environmental issues from a global perspective and reached major agreements on the need for an integrated approach in confronting the challenges of economic development and the environment.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_068">Stephan Schmidheiny, with the Business Council for Sustainable Development, <em class="emphasis">Changing Course</em> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1992), xxi.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s03_p09">The WBCSD published a book in 1992 titled <em class="emphasis">Changing Course</em>, in which the objectives of business and the environment were argued to be compatible. Schmidheiny wrote that business must “devise strategies to maximize added value while minimizing resource and energy use,” and that “given the large technological and productive capacity of business, any progress toward sustainable development requires its active leadership.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_069">Stephan Schmidheiny, with the Business Council for Sustainable Development, <em class="emphasis">Changing Course</em> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1992), 9.</span> This language represented a mainstreaming of what is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">eco-efficiency</a><span class="glossdef">A conceptual framework that seeks to reduce the amount of material and energy needed to manufacture and use products over the product life cycle, thus minimizing waste and costs while boosting profits.</span></span> in business. The WBCSD opened new doors. Its work signaled acceptance of the new term <em class="emphasis">sustainable business</em> and hinted at <em class="emphasis">sustainability</em> as a term that referred to an alternative economic growth pattern. Sustainable business, defined as improving the efficiency of resource use, was beginning to be recognized by global business leaders as an activity in which corporations could legitimately engage. The important shift under way was that the notion of sustainability was moving from small pockets of visionary business leaders and development specialists to the broader international business community.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s03_p10">It made sense. World population growth trajectories predicted emerging economies growing at an accelerating rate. Their societies’ legitimate aspirations to live according to Western developed economies’ standards would require a tremendous acceleration in the throughput of raw materials, massive growth in industrial activity, and unprecedented demand for energy. People were beginning to wonder how that growth would be achieved in a way that preserved ecological systems, protected human health, and supported stable, viable communities. <a class="xref" href="#larson-ch01_s03_f02">Figure 1.8 "Actual and Predicted Global Population Growth, 1750–2050 (billions)"</a> shows the significant increases in emerging economy populations compared to developed countries after 1950.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s03_p11">Of no small significance, certain publications emerged and within a few years were read widely by those interested in the debates over economic growth and population trajectories. In 1993, Paul Hawken authored <em class="emphasis">The Ecology of Commerce</em>, which brought to the public’s attention an alternative model of commerce without waste that relies on renewable energy sources, eliminates toxins, and thrives on biodiversity. Hawken moved beyond the WBCSD goals of minimization (eco-efficiency) by suggesting a restorative economy “that is so intelligently designed and constructed that it mimics nature at every step, a symbiosis of company and customer and ecology.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_070">Paul Hawken, <em class="emphasis">The Ecology of Commerce</em> (New York: Harper Business, 1993), 12, 15.</span> Written for a broad audience, Hawken’s book became a must-read for those trying to grasp the tensions among economic growth, the viability of natural systems, and the possibilities for change. An entrepreneur himself, Hawken looked to markets, firms, and an entrepreneurial mind-set to solve many of the problems.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s03_p12">In 1991, strategy thinker and Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter published articles about green strategy in <em class="emphasis">Scientific American</em>, and in 1995 his article with Claas van der Linde called “Green and Competitive: Ending the Stalemate” appeared in the <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_071">Michael E.

Earlier classics such as Garrett Hardin’s “The Tragedy of the Commons” and Kenneth Boulding’s “The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth” continued to serve as foundations for new thinking about the contours of future business growth.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_073">Garrett Hardin, “The Tragedy of the Commons,” <em class="emphasis">Science</em> 16 (1968): 1243–48; Kenneth Boulding, “The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth” (paper presented at the Sixth Resources for the Future Forum on Environmental Quality in a Growing Economy, Washington, DC, March 8, 1966).</span> A body of research and new reasoning was accumulating and diffusing, driving change in how people thought.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s03_p13">Even as the relationship among conventional business perspectives and environmental, health, and social issues shifted, albeit slowly, global problems continued to mount. Climate change debate moved from exclusively scientific conversations to mainstream media outlets. In the summer of 1988, an unprecedented heat wave attacked the United States, killing livestock by the thousands and wiping out a third of the country’s grain crop. The issue of global warming or, more appropriately, global climate change entered the headlines with new force.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_074">Kirkpatrick Sale, <em class="emphasis">The Green Revolution: The American Environmental Movement, 1962–1992</em> (New York: Hill &amp; Wang, 1993), 71.</span> During the heat wave, Dr. James E.

Citing a 30 percent rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide since the dawn of the Industrial Age, the IPCC reported that “the balance of evidence suggests a discernable human influence on global climate.” Twenty-four hundred scientists endorsed these findings.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_076">Paul Raeburn, “Global Warming: Is There Still Room for Doubt?” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, November 3, 1997, 158.</span></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s03_p20">Slowly, however, the groundwork was laid for significant and prevalent changes in how businesses relate to the environment. In the 1987 <em class="emphasis">Our Common Future</em> report discussed in <a class="xref" href="larson-ch01#larson-ch01">Chapter 1 "History"</a>, <a class="xref" href="larson-ch01_s02#larson-ch01_s02">Section 1.2 "Business Shifts Its Focus"</a>, the commission wrote, “Many essential human needs can be met only through goods and services provided by industry.…Industry extracts materials from the natural resource base and inserts both products and pollution into the human environment. It has the power to enhance or degrade the environment; it invariably does both.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_081">World Commission on Environment and Development, <em class="emphasis">Our Common Future</em> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1987), 206.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s03_p21">Embedded within the statement was a particular linkage among previously conflicting interests. This would usher in a new way of doing business. As Mohan Munasinghe of the IPCC explained, “sustainable development necessarily involves the pursuit of economic efficiency, social equity, and environmental protection.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_082">Mohan Munasinghe, Wilfrido Cruz, and Jeremy Warford, “Are Economy-wide Policies Good for the Environment?” <em class="emphasis">Finance and Development</em> 30, no. 3 (September 1993): 40.</span> Thus, beginning in the 1990s, thanks to the efforts of a small number of pioneering firms and spokespersons able to span the science-business gap, sustainability as a business strategy was emerging as a powerful new perspective to create value for multiple stakeholders. A sustainable business perspective—and the sustainability innovations created by entrepreneurs—is the current evolutionary stage in an increasingly sophisticated corporate response to environmental and social concerns.</p>

        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="larson-ch01_s03_l02">
            <li>In the 1980s and 1990s, population growth and the scale of industrialization and concomitant environmental concerns led to the pursuit of “sustainable” business models that acknowledged health and ecological system constraints.</li>
            <li>Pressure on companies grew due to scientific discoveries about pollutants, waste disposal challenges, oil spills, and other accidents.</li>
            <li>Proliferation and diffusion of reports educated the public and government officials, resulting in increased pressure for regulatory action and corporate response.</li>

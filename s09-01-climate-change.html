    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch05_s01_p02">Since the beginning of their history, humans have altered their environment. Only recently, however, have we realized how human activities influence earth’s terrestrial, hydrological, and atmospheric systems to the extent that these systems may no longer maintain the stable climate and services we have assumed as the basis of our economies. The science of climate change developed rapidly in the late twentieth century as researchers established a correlation between increasing atmospheric concentrations of certain gases, human activities emitting those gases, and a rapid increase in global temperatures. Many, but by no means all, international policy makers spurred research as it became apparent that impacts ranging from melting polar ice caps to acidified oceans and extreme weather patterns were attributed to anthropogenic (human) influences on climate. Global businesses, many of which initially balked at potential economic disruption from changes in the use of fossil fuel and other business practices, have largely acceded to the need for change. Nonetheless, the overall response to the challenge has been slow and not without resistance, thereby increasing the potential opportunities and urgency.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch05_s01_s01_p01">In the early 1820s, Joseph Fourier, the French pioneer in the mathematics of heat diffusion, became interested in why some heat from the sun was retained by the earth and its atmosphere rather than being reflected back into space. Fourier conceived of the atmosphere as a bell jar with the atmospheric gases retaining heat and thereby acting as the containing vessel. In 1896, Swedish Nobel laureate and physicist Svante August Arrhenius published a paper in which he calculated how carbon dioxide (CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>) could affect the temperature of the earth. He and early atmospheric scientists recognized that normal carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere contributed to making the earth habitable. Scientists also have known for some time that air pollution alters weather. For example, certain industrial air pollutants can significantly increase rainfall downwind of their source. As intensive agriculture and industrial activity have expanded very rapidly around the world since 1850 (<a class="xref" href="#larson-ch05_s01_s01_f01">Figure 5.1 "Increase in Global Carbon Emissions from Fossil Fuel Combustion, 1750–2006"</a>), a growing body of scientific evidence has accumulated to suggest that humans influence global climate.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch05_s01_s01_p02">The earth’s climate has always varied, which initially raised doubts about the significance of human influences on climate or suggested our impact may have been positive. Successive ice ages, after all, likely were triggered by subtle changes in the earth’s orbit or atmosphere and would presumably recur. Indeed, changes in one earth system, such as solar energy reaching the earth’s surface, can alter other systems, such as ocean circulation, through various feedback loops. The dinosaurs are thought to have gone extinct when a meteor struck the earth, causing tsunamis, earthquakes, fires, and palls of ash and dust that would have hindered photosynthesis and lowered oxygen levels and temperatures. Aside from acute catastrophes, however, climate has changed slowly, on the scale of tens of thousands to millions of years. The same paleoclimatological data also suggest a strong correlation between atmospheric CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> levels and surface temperatures over the past 400,000 years and indicate that the last 20 years have been the warmest of the previous 1,000.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn05_002">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Paleoclimatology, “A Paleo Perspective on Global Warming,” July 13, 2009, accessed August 19, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/globalwarming/home.html">http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/globalwarming/home.html</a>.</span></p>

The Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories implemented the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Program.

These experts were neither employed nor compensated by the IPCC nor by the United Nations system for this work.</span> The IPCC’s First Assessment Report, published in 1990, concluded that the average global temperature was indeed rising and that human activity was to some degree responsible (<a class="xref" href="#larson-ch05_s01_s01_f04">Figure 5.4 "Temperature Elevation, 1880–2009"</a>). This report laid the groundwork for negotiation of the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty to reduce GHG emissions that met with limited success. Subsequent IPCC reports and myriad other studies indicated that climate change was occurring faster and with worse consequences than initially anticipated.</p>

When the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize to the IPCC and Al Gore, he said, “A goal in our modern world must be to maintain ‘human security’ in the broadest sense.” Similarly, albeit with different interests in mind, the United States’ 2008 National Intelligence Assessment, which analyzes emerging threats to national security, focused specifically on climate change.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn05_013">Ole Danbolt Mjøs, “Award Ceremony Speech” (presentation speech for the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, Oslo, Norway, December 10, 2007), accessed January 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2007/presentation-speech.html">http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2007/presentation-speech.html</a>.</span></p>

The convention was adopted in May 1992 and became the first binding international legal instrument dealing directly with climate change. It was presented for signature at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and went into force in March 1994 with signatures from 166 countries. By 2010 the convention had been accepted by 193 countries.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn05_016">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, “Status of Ratification of the Convention,” accessed January 27, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/status_of_ratification/items/2613.php">http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/status_of_ratification/items/2613.php</a>.</span> UNFCCC signatories met in 1997 in Kyoto and agreed to a schedule of reduction targets known as the Kyoto Protocol. Industrialized countries committed to reducing emissions of specific GHGs, averaged over 2008–12, to 5 percent below 1990 levels. The European Union (EU) committed to an 8 percent reduction and the United States to 7 percent. Other industrialized countries agreed to lesser reductions or to hold their emissions constant, while developing countries made no commitments but hoped to industrialize more cleanly than their predecessors. Partly to help developing countries, the Kyoto Protocol also created a market for trading GHG emission allowances. If one country developed a carbon sink, such as by planting a forest, another country could buy the amount of carbon sequestered and use it to negate the equivalent amount of its own emissions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch05_s01_s03_p02">The Kyoto Protocol has ultimately suffered from a lack of political will in the United States and abroad. The United States signed it, but the Senate never ratified it. US President George W. Bush backed away from the emission reduction targets and eventually rejected them entirely. By the time he took office in 2001, a 7 percent reduction from 1990 levels for the United States would have translated into a 30 percent reduction from 2001 levels. US GHG emissions, instead of declining, rose 14 percent from 1990 to 2008 (see <a class="xref" href="#larson-ch05_s01_s03_f01">Figure 5.8 "Increase in US Energy Consumption, Total and Renewable, in Billions of BTU, 1949–2008"</a> for related energy consumption).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn05_017">US Environmental Protection Agency, <em class="emphasis">2010 Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report</em> (Washington, DC: US Environmental Protection Agency, 2010), accessed January 29, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/downloads10/US-GHG-Inventory-2010_ExecutiveSummary.pdf">http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/downloads10/US-GHG -Inventory-2010_ExecutiveSummary.pdf</a>.</span> Almost all other Kyoto signatories will also fail to meet their goals.

        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch05_s01_s03_p03">The Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012, so meetings have begun to negotiate new goals. In December 2007, UNFCCC countries met in Bali to discuss a successor treaty. The conference made little headway, and countries met again in December 2009 in Copenhagen. That conference again failed to generate legally binding reduction goals, but the countries confirmed the dangers of climate change and agreed to strive to limit temperature increases to no more than 2°C total. A subsequent meeting was held in Cancun, Mexico, in late 2010.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch05_s01_s03_p04">Individual countries and US states and agencies have acted, nonetheless, in the absence of broader leadership. In 2007, EU countries set their own future emissions reduction goals, the so-called 20-20-20 strategy of reducing emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 while reducing energy demand 20 percent through efficiency and generating 20 percent of energy from renewable resources. In January 2008 the European Commission proposed binding legislation to implement the 20-20-20 targets. This “climate and energy package” was approved by the European Parliament and Council in December 2008. It became law in June 2009.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn05_019">European Commission, “The EU Climate and Energy Package,” accessed January 29, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/brief/eu/package_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/brief/eu/package_en.htm</a> and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/climate_action.htm">http://ec.europa.eu /environment/climat/climate_action.htm</a>.</span> In the Northeast United States, ten states collaborated to form the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which caps and gradually lowers GHG emissions from power plants by 10 percent from 2009 to 2018.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Corporate Response and Opportunity</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch05_s01_s04_p01">Certain industries are more vulnerable than others to the economic impacts of climate change. Industries that are highly dependent on fossil fuels and high CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> emitters, such as oil and gas companies, cement producers, automobile manufacturers, airlines, and power plant operators, are closely watching legislation related to GHGs. The reinsurance industry, which over the past several years has taken large financial losses due to extreme weather events, is deeply concerned about global climate change and liabilities for its impacts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch05_s01_s04_p02">Given the potential costs of ignoring climate change, the costs of addressing it appear rather minimal. In 2006, the UK Treasury released the <em class="emphasis">Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change</em>. The report estimated that the most immediate effects of global warming would cause damages of “at least 5% of global GDP each year, now and forever. If a wider range of risks and impacts is taken into account, the estimates of damage could rise to 20% of GDP or more.” Actions to mitigate the change, in contrast, would cost only about 1 percent of global GDP between 2010 and 2030.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn05_023">Lord Stern, “Executive Summary,” in <em class="emphasis">Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change</em> (London: HM Treasury, 2006), 1, accessed January 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/sternreview_index.htm">http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/sternreview_index.htm</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch05_s01_s04_p03">Corporate reactions have ranged from taking action now to reduce or eliminate emissions of GHGs and active engagement with carbon trading markets to actively opposing new policies that might require changes in products or processes. Anticipatory firms are developing scenarios for potential threats and opportunities related to those policies, public opinion, and resource constraints. Among those companies actively pursuing a reduction in GHGs, some cite financial gains for their actions. Walmart and General Electric both committed to major sustainability efforts in the first decade of the twenty-first century as have many smaller corporations. Central to their strategies are GHG reduction tactics.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch05_s01_s04_p04">Excessive GHG emissions may reflect inefficient energy use or loss of valuable assets, such as when natural gas escapes during production or use. The Carbon Disclosure Project emerged in 2000 as a private organization to track GHG emissions for companies that volunteered to disclose their data. By 2010, over 1,500 companies belonged to the organization, and institutional investors used these and other data to screen companies for corporate social responsibility. Out of concern for good corporate citizenship and in anticipation of potential future regulation, GHG emissions trading has become a growing market involving many large corporations. The emissions trading process involves credits for renewable energy generation, carbon sequestration, and low-emission agricultural and industrial practices that are bought and sold or optioned in anticipation of variable abilities to reach emissions reduction targets. Some companies have enacted internal, competitive emissions reduction goals and trading schemes as a way to involve all corporate divisions in a search for efficiency, cleaner production methods, and identification of other opportunities for reducing their contribution to climate change.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch05_s01_s04_p05">In parallel to tracking GHG emissions, clean tech or clean commerce has become increasingly prevalent as a concept and a term to describe technologies, such as wind energy, and processes, such as more efficient electrical grids, that do not generate as much or any pollution.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch05_s01_s05_p01">Our climate may always be changing, but humans have changed it dramatically in a short time with potentially dire consequences. GHGs emitted from human activities have increased the global temperature and will continue to increase it, even if we ceased all emissions today. International policy makers have built consensus for the need to curb global climate change but have struggled to take specific, significant actions. In contrast, at a smaller scale, local governments and corporations have attempted to mitigate and adapt to an altered future. Taking a proactive stance on climate change can make good business sense.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch05_s01_s05_p02">At a minimum, strategic planning should be informed by climate change concerns and the inherent liabilities and opportunities therein. Whether operationalized by large firms or smaller companies, one important form of entrepreneurial innovation inspired by climate change challenges today is to apply tools associated with reduced climate and resource footprints that result in systemic reduction of energy and material inputs. When applied within firms and across supply chains, such tools increase profitability by lowering costs. More important, these measures can lead to innovations made visible by the efforts. At minimum, opportunities for product design and process improvements that both reduce climate change impact and increase resource efficiency and consumer loyalty make sense. Companies that chart a course around the most likely set of future conditions with an eye to competitive advantage, good corporate citizenship, and stewardship of natural resources are likely to optimize their profitability and flexibility—and hence their strategic edge—in the future.</p>

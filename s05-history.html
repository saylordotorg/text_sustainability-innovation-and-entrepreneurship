    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s01_p01">Sustainability innovations, currently driven by a subset of today’s entrepreneurial actors, represent the new generation of business responses to health, ecological, and social concerns. The entrepreneurial innovations we will discuss in this book reflect emerging scientific knowledge, widening public concern, and government regulation directed toward a cleaner economy. The US roots of today’s sustainability innovations go back to the 1960s, when health and environmental problems became considerably more visible. By 1970, the issues had intensified such that both government and business had to address the growing public worries. The US environmental regulatory framework that emerged in the 1970s was a response to growing empirical evidence that the post–World War II design of industrial activity was an increasing threat to human health and environmental system functioning.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s01_p02">We must keep in mind, however, that industrialization and in particular the commercial system that emerged post–World War II delivered considerable advantages to a global population. To state the obvious: there have been profoundly important advances in the human condition as a consequence of industrialization. In most countries, life spans have been extended, infant mortality dramatically reduced, and diseases conquered. Remarkable technological advances have made our lives healthier, extended education, and made us materially more comfortable. Communication advances have tied people together into a single global community, able to connect to each other and advance the common good in ways that were unimaginable a short time ago. Furthermore, wealth creation activity by business and the resulting rise in living standards have brought millions of people out of poverty. It is this creative capacity, our positive track record, and a well-founded faith in our ability to learn, adapt, and evolve toward more beneficial methods of value creation that form the platform for the innovative changes discussed in this text. Human beings are adept at solving problems, and problems represent system feedback that can inform future action. Therefore, we begin this discussion with a literal and symbolic feedback loop presented to the American public in the 1960s.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s01_p03">Widespread public awareness about environmental issues originated with the publication of the book <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Silent Spring</a><span class="glossdef">The book <em class="emphasis">Silent Spring</em> was a direct challenge to the chemical industry and to the prevalent societal optimism toward chemicals.

Carson, a biologist, argued that the spraying of the synthetic pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) was causing a dramatic decline in bird populations, poisoning the food chain, and thus ultimately harming humans. Similar to Upton Sinclair’s 1906 book <em class="emphasis">The Jungle</em> and its exposé of the shocking conditions in the American meatpacking industry, <em class="emphasis">Silent Spring</em> was a dramatic challenge to the chemical industry and to the prevalent societal optimism toward technology and post–World War II chemical use. Its publication ignited a firestorm of publicity and controversy. Predictably, the chemical industry reacted quickly and strongly to the book’s threat and was critical of Carson and her ideas. In an article titled “Nature Is for the Birds,” industry journal <em class="emphasis">Chemical Week</em> described organic farmers and those opposed to chemical pesticides as “a motley lot” ranging from “superstition-ridden illiterates to educated scientists, from cultists to relatively reasonable men and women” and strongly suggesting Carson’s claims were unwarranted.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_001">“Nature Is for the Birds,” <em class="emphasis">Chemical Week</em>, July 28, 1962, 5, quoted in Andrew J.

The book, with a “prose and format similar to Carson’s…described a small town beset by cholera and malaria and unable to produce adequate crops because it lacked the chemical pesticides necessary to ward off harmful pests.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_002">Andrew J.

    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s01_p05">Throughout the 1960s, well-publicized news stories were adding momentum to the call for comprehensive federal environmental legislation. The nation’s air quality had deteriorated rapidly, and in 1963 high concentrations of air pollutants in New York City caused approximately three hundred deaths and thousands of injuries.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_006">G. Tyler Miller and Scott Spoolman, <em class="emphasis">Living in the Environment: Principles, Connections, and Solutions</em>, 16th ed. (Belmont, CA: Brooks/Cole, 2009), 535.</span> At the same time, cities like Los Angeles, Chattanooga, and Pittsburgh had become infamous for their dense smog. Polluted urban areas, once considered unpleasant and unattractive inconveniences that accompanied growth and job creation, were by the 1960s definitively connected by empirical studies to a host of respiratory problems.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s01_p06">Urban air quality was not the only concern. Questions were also being raised about the safety of drinking water and food supplies that were dependent on freshwater resources. In 1964, over a million dead fish washed up on the banks of the Mississippi River, threatening the water supplies of nearby towns. The source of the fish kill was traced to pesticide leaks, specifically endrin, which was manufactured by Velsicol.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_007">Andrew J. Hoffman, <em class="emphasis">From Heresy to Dogma: An Institutional History of Corporate Environmentalism</em> (San Francisco: New Lexington Press, 1997), 52.</span> Several other instances of polluted waterways added to the public’s awareness of the deterioration of the nation’s rivers, streams, and lakes and put pressure on legislators to take action. In the mid-1960s, foam from nonbiodegradable cleansers and laundry detergents began to appear in rivers and creeks. By the late 1960s, Lake Erie was so heavily polluted that millions of fish died and many of the beaches along the lake had to be closed.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_008">G. Tyler Miller and Scott Spoolman, <em class="emphasis">Living in the Environment: Principles, Connections, and Solutions</em>, 16th ed.

However, it was not the first time; the river had burst into flame multiple times since 1968.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s01_p08">Adding to air and drinking water concerns was the growing problem of coastal pollution from human activity. Pollution from offshore oil drilling gained national attention in 1969 when a Union Oil Company offshore platform near Santa Barbara, California, punctured an uncharted fissure, releasing an estimated 3.25 million gallons of thick crude oil into the ocean. Although neither the first nor the worst oil spill on record, the accident coated the entire coastline of the city of Santa Barbara with oil, along with most of the coasts of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. The incident received national media attention given the beautiful coastal location of the spill. In response to the spill, a local environmental group calling itself Get Oil Out (GOO) collected 110,000 signatures on a petition to the government to stop further offshore drilling. President Nixon, a resident of California, complied and imposed a temporary moratorium on California offshore development.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_010">Andrew J.

    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s01_p09">Influenced by these events and the proliferation of environmental news stories and public discourse, citizens of industrialized countries had begun to shift their perceptions about the larger physical world. Several influential books and articles introduced to the general public the concept of a finite world. Economist Kenneth Boulding, in his 1966 essay “The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth,” coined the metaphors of “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">spaceship Earth</a><span class="glossdef">Coined by Kenneth Boulding in his 1966 essay “The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth,” this term suggests that the earth is a closed system with finite resources and capacities.</span></span>” and “spaceman economy” to emphasize that the earth was a closed system and that the economy must therefore focus not on “production and consumption at all, but the nature, extent, quality, and complexity of the total capital stock.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_011">See Kenneth E. Boulding, “The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth,” in <em class="emphasis">Environmental Quality in a Growing Economy</em>, ed. Henry Jarrett (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1966), 3–14.</span> Paul Ehrlich, in the follow-up to his 1968 best seller <em class="emphasis">The Population Bomb</em>, borrowed Boulding’s metaphor in his 1971 book <em class="emphasis">How to Be a Survivor</em> to argue that in a closed system, exponential population growth and resource consumption would breach the carrying capacity of nature, assuring misery for all passengers aboard the “spaceship.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_012">Philip Shabecoff, <em class="emphasis">A Fierce Green Fire: The American Environmental Movement</em> (New York: Hill &amp; Wang, 1993), 95–96.</span> Garrett Hardin’s now famous essay, “The Tragedy of the Commons,” was published in the prestigious journal <em class="emphasis">Science</em> in December 1968.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_013">Kenneth E.

    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s01_p10">Another symbolic turning point came in 1969 during the Apollo 11 mission, when the first photograph of the earth was taken from outer space. The image became an icon for the environmental movement. During that time period and subsequently, quotations proliferated about the new relationship between humans and their planetary home. In a speech at San Fernando Valley State College on September 26, 1966, the vice president of the United States Hubert H. Humphrey said, “As we begin to comprehend that the earth itself is a kind of manned spaceship hurtling through the infinity of space—it will seem increasingly absurd that we have not better organized the life of the human family.” In the December 23, 1968, edition of <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, Frank Borman, commander of Apollo 8, said, “When you’re finally up at the moon looking back on earth, all those differences and nationalistic traits are pretty well going to blend, and you’re going to get a concept that maybe this really is one world and why the hell can’t we learn to live together like decent people.”</p>

The CAA set national air quality standards for particulates, sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, ozone, hydrocarbons, and lead, averaged over different time periods. Two levels of air quality standards were established: primary standards to protect human health, and secondary standards to protect plant and animal life, maintain visibility, and protect buildings. The primary and secondary standards often have been identical in practice. The act also regulated that new stationary sources, such as power plants, set emissions standards, that standards for cars and trucks be established, and required states to develop implementation plans indicating how they would achieve the guidelines set by the act within the allotted time.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Corporate Response: Pollution Control</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s01_p01">Pollution control typified the corporate response to environmental regulations from the genesis of the modern regulatory framework in the 1970s through the 1980s. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Pollution control</a><span class="glossdef">A method to prevent the release of emissions and other by-products into the environment after those wastes have been generated. Typical techniques include scrubbers and filters to trap pollutants.</span></span> is an end-of-the-pipe strategy that focuses on waste treatment or the filtering of emissions or both. Pollution control strategies assume no change to product design or production methods, only attention to air, solid, and water waste streams at the end of the manufacturing process. This approach can be costly and typically imposes a burden on the company, though it may save expenses in the form of fines levied by regulatory agencies for regulatory noncompliance. Usually pollution control is implemented by companies to comply with regulations and reflects an adversarial relationship between business and government. The causes of this adversarial attitude were revealed in a 1974 survey by the Conference Board—an independent, nonprofit business research organization—that found that few companies viewed pollution control as profitable and none found it to be an opportunity to improve production procedures.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_026">Andrew J. Hoffman, <em class="emphasis">From Heresy to Dogma: An Institutional History of Corporate Environmentalism</em> (San Francisco: New Lexington Press, 1997), 81.</span> Hence, from a strictly profit-oriented viewpoint, one that considers neither public reaction to pollution nor potential future liability as affecting the bottom line, pollution control put the company in a “losing” position with respect to environmental protection.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s01_p02">The environmental regulatory structure of the United States at times has forced companies into a pollution control position by mandating specific technologies, setting strict compliance deadlines, and concentrating on cleanup instead of prevention.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_027">Michael Porter and Claas van der Linde, “Green and Competitive: Ending the Stalemate,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em> 73, no. 5 (September/October 1995): 120–34.</span> This was evident in a 1986 report by the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) that found that “over 99 percent of federal and state environmental spending is devoted to controlling pollution after waste is generated. Less than 1 percent is spent to reduce the generation of waste.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_028">US Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, <em class="emphasis">Serious Reduction of Hazardous Waste</em> (Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, 1986), quoted in Stephan Schmidheiny, with the Business Council for Sustainable Development, <em class="emphasis">Changing Course</em> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1992), 106.</span> The OTA at that time noted the misplaced emphasis on pollution control in regulation and concluded that existing technologies alone could <em class="emphasis">prevent</em> half of all industrial wastes.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_029">Stephan Schmidheiny, with the Business Council for Sustainable Development, <em class="emphasis">Changing Course</em> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1992), 100.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s01_p03">Economists generally agree that it is better for regulation to require a result rather require a means to accomplishing that result. Requiring pollution control is preferred because it provides an incentive for firms to reduce pollution rather than simply move hazardous materials from one place to another, which does not solve the original problem of waste generation. For example, business researchers Michael Porter and Claas van der Linde draw a distinction between good regulations and bad regulations by whether they encourage innovation and thus enhance competitiveness while simultaneously addressing environmental concerns. Pollution control regulations, they argue, should promote resource productivity but often are written in ways that discourage the risk taking and experimentation that would benefit society and the regulated corporation: “For example, a company that innovates and achieves 95 percent of target emissions reduction while also registering substantial offsetting cost reductions is still 5 percent out of compliance and subject to liability. On the other hand, regulators would reward it for adopting safe but expensive secondary treatment.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_030">Michael Porter and Claas van der Linde, “Green and Competitive: Ending the Stalemate,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em> 73, no. 5 (September/October 1995): 120–34.</span> Regulations that discouraged innovation and mandated the end-of-the-pipe mind-set that was common among regulators and industry in the 1970s and 1980s contributed to the adversarial approach to environmental protection. As these conflicts between business and government heated up, new science, an energy crisis, and growing public protests fueled the fire.</p>

Using mathematical models developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to project trends in population growth, resource depletion, food supplies, capital investment, and pollution, the group reached a three-part conclusion. First, if the then-present trends held, the limits of growth on Earth would be reached within one hundred years. Second, these trends could be altered to establish economic and ecological stability that would be sustainable far into the future. Third, if the world chose to select the second outcome, chances of success would increase the sooner work began to attain it.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_031">Philip Shabecoff, <em class="emphasis">A Fierce Green Fire: The American Environmental Movement</em> (New York: Hill &amp; Wang, 1993), 96.

        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s02_p02">Perhaps the most dramatic wake-up call came in the form of political revenge. Americans were tangibly and painfully introduced to the concept of limited resources when, in 1973, Arab members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) banned oil shipments to the United States in retaliation for America’s support of Israel in its eighteen-day Yom Kippur War with Syria and Egypt. Prices for oil-based products, including gasoline, skyrocketed.

However, with the end of gasoline shortages and high prices, these voices faded into the background. Of course, a strong resurgence of such ideas followed the price spikes of 2008, when crude oil prices exceeded $140 per barrel.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_033">Energy Information Administration, Department of Energy, “Petroleum,” accessed November 29, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oil_gas/petroleum/info_glance/petroleum.html">http://www.eia.doe.gov/oil_gas/petroleum/info_glance/petroleum.html</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s02_p03">In the years following the 1973 energy crisis, public and government attention turned once again toward the dangers posed by chemicals. On July 10, 1976, an explosion at a chemical plant in Seveso, Italy, released a cloud of the highly toxic chemical called dioxin. Some nine hundred local residents were evacuated, many of whom suffered disfiguring skin diseases and lasting illnesses as a result of the disaster. Birth defects increased locally following the blast, and the soil was so severely contaminated that the top eight inches from an area of seven square miles had to be removed and buried.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_034">Clive Ponting, <em class="emphasis">A Green History of the World</em> (New York: Penguin Books, 1991), 372–73.</span> Andrew Hoffman, in his study of the American environmental movement in business, noted that “for many in the United States, the incident at Seveso cast a sinister light on their local chemical plant.

        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s02_p04">Over time, these developments built pressure for additional regulation of business. Politicians continued to listen to the concerns of US citizens. In 1976, the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA) was passed over intense industry objections.

The basis of the CWA was enacted in 1948 and was called the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, but the act was significantly reorganized and expanded in 1972. ‘Clean Water Act’ became the Act’s common name with amendments in 1977.” Under the CWA, industry wastewater and water quality standards were set for industry and all surface-water contaminants. In addition, permits were required to discharge pollutants under the EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program.

        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s02_p05">In the late 1970s, America’s attention turned once again to energy issues. In 1978, Iran triggered a second oil shock by suddenly cutting back its petroleum exports to the United States. A year later, confidence in nuclear power, a technology many looked to as a viable alternative form of energy, was severely undermined by a near catastrophe. On March 29, 1979, the number two reactor at Three Mile Island near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, lost its coolant water due to a series of mechanical failures and operator errors. Approximately half of the reactor’s core melted, and investigators later found that if a particular valve had remained stuck open for another thirty to sixty minutes, a complete meltdown would have occurred. The accident resulted in the evacuation of fifty thousand people, with another fifty thousand fleeing voluntarily. The amount of radioactive material released into the atmosphere as a result of the accident is unknown, though no deaths were immediately attributable to the incident. Cleanup of the damaged reactor has cost $1.2 billion to date, almost twice its $700 million construction cost.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_039">Tyler Miller Jr., <em class="emphasis">Living in the Environment: Principles, Connections, and Solutions</em>, 9th ed.

In 1942, Hooker Electro-Chemical Company purchased the abandoned Love Canal property in Niagara Falls, New York. Over the next eleven years, 21,800 tons of toxic chemicals were dumped into the canal. Hooker, later purchased by Occidental Chemical Corporation, sold the land to the city of Niagara Falls in 1953 with a warning in the property deed that the site contained hazardous chemicals. The city later constructed an elementary school on the site, with roads and sewer lines running through it and homes surrounding it. By the mid-1970s, the chemicals had begun to rise to the surface and seep into basements.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_042">Andrew J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s02_p07">Love Canal led directly to one of the most controversial pieces of environmental legislation ever enacted. On December 12, 1980, President Carter signed into law the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), or Superfund. This law made companies liable retroactively for cleanup of waste sites, regardless of their level of involvement. Love Canal also signaled the beginning of a new form of environmental problem. As environmental historian Hoffman indicated, “Environmental problems, heretofore assumed to be visible and foreseeable, could now originate from an unexpected source, appear many years later, and inflict both immediate and latent health and ecological damage. Now problems could emerge from a place as seemingly safe as your own backyard.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_045">Andrew J. Hoffman, <em class="emphasis">From Heresy to Dogma: An Institutional History of Corporate Environmentalism</em> (San Francisco: New Lexington Press, 1997), 79.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s02_p08">In the face of vehement industry opposition, the states and the federal government managed to put in place a wide-ranging series of regulations that defined standards of practice and forced the adoption of pollution control technologies. To oversee and enforce these regulations, taxpayers’ dollars now funded a large new public bureaucracy. In the coming years, the size and scope of those agencies would come under fire from proindustry administrations elected on a platform of smaller government and less oversight and intervention.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s02_p09">In the meantime, the creation of the EPA compelled many states to create their own equivalent departments for environmental protection, often to administer or enforce EPA programs if nothing else. According to Denise Scheberle, an expert on federalism and environmental policy, “few policy areas placed greater and more diverse demands on states than environmental programs.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_046">Denise Scheberle, <em class="emphasis">Federalism and Environmental Policy: Trust and the Politics of Implementation</em>, 2nd ed. (Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press, 2004), 5.</span> Some states, such as California, continued to press for stricter environmental standards than those set by the federal government. Almost all states have seen their relationships with the EPA vary from antagonistic to cooperative over the decades, depending on what states felt was being asked of them, why it was being asked, and how much financial assistance was being provided.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s02_p10">Despite growing public awareness and the previous decade of federal legislation to protect the environment, scientific studies were still predicting ecological disaster. President Carter’s Council on Environmental Quality, in conjunction with the State Department, produced a study in 1980 of world ecological problems called <em class="emphasis">The Global 2000 Report</em>. The report warned that “if present trends continue, the world in 2000 will be more crowded, more polluted, less stable ecologically, and more vulnerable to disruption than the world we live in now. Serious stresses involving population, resources, and the environment are clearly visible ahead. Despite greater material output, the world’s people will be poorer in many ways than they are today.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_047">United States Council on Environmental Quality and the Department of State, <em class="emphasis">The Global 2000 Report to the President</em> (Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, 1980), 1.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s02_p11">Despite forecasts like this, the election of Ronald Reagan in November of 1980 marked a dramatic decline in federal support for existing and planned environmental legislation. With Reagan’s 1981 appointments of two aggressive champions of industry, James Watt as secretary of the interior and Anne Buford as administrator of the EPA, it was apparent that the nation’s environmental policies were a prime target of his “small government” revolution. In its early years, the Reagan administration moved rapidly to cut budgets, reduce environmental enforcement, and open public lands for mining, drilling, grazing, and other private uses. In 1983, however, Buford was forced to resign amid congressional investigations into mismanagement of a toxic waste cleanup, and Watt resigned after several statements he made were widely viewed as insensitive to actions damaging to the environment. Under Buford’s successors, William Ruckelshaus and Lee Thomas, the environmental agency returned to a moderate course as both men made an effort to restore morale and public trust.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s02_p12">However, environmental crises continued to shape public opinion and environmental laws in the 1980s. In December 1984, approximately forty-five tons of methyl isocyanine gas leaked from an underground storage tank at a Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal, India. The accident, which was far worse than the Seveso incident eight years earlier, caused 2,000 immediate deaths, another 1,500 deaths in the ensuing months, and over 300,000 injuries. The pesticide plant was closed, and the Indian government took Union Carbide to court. Mediation resulted in a settlement payment by Union Carbide of $470 million.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_048">Andrew J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s02_p17">Until the mid-1980s, environmental disasters were perceived to be confined to geographically limited locations and people rarely feared contamination from beyond their local chemical or power plant. This notion changed in 1986 when an explosion inside a reactor at a nuclear plant in Chernobyl in the Ukraine released a gigantic cloud of radioactive debris that standard weather patterns spread from the Soviet Union to Scandinavia and Western Europe. The effects were severe and persistent. As a result of the explosion, some 21,000 people in Western Europe were expected to die of cancer and even more to contract the disease as a result. Reindeer in Lapland were found to have levels of radioactivity seven times above the norm. By 1990 sheep in northwest England and Wales were still too radioactive to be consumed. Within the former Soviet Union, over 10,000 square kilometers of land were determined to be unsafe for human habitation, yet much of the land remained occupied and farming continued. Approximately 115,000 people were evacuated from the area surrounding the plant site, 220 villages were abandoned, and another 600 villages required “decontamination.” It is estimated that the lives of over 100,000 people in the former Soviet Union have been or will likely be severely affected by the accident.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_051">Clive Ponting, <em class="emphasis">A Green History of the World</em> (New York: Penguin Books, 1991), 377; World Health Organization, “Health Effects of the Chernobyl Accident: An Overview,” Fact sheet no. 303, April 2006, accessed April 19, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs303/en/index.html">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs303/en/index.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s02_p18">Other environmental problems of an international scale made headlines during the 1980s. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from smokestacks and tailpipes can be carried over six hundred miles by prevailing winds and often return to ground as acid rain. As a result, Wheeling, West Virginia, once received rain with a pH value almost equivalent to battery acid.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_052">Tyler Miller Jr., <em class="emphasis">Living in the Environment: Principles, Connections, and Solutions</em>, 9th ed. (Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 1996), 436.</span> As a result of such deposition, downwind lakes and streams become increasingly acidic and toxic to aquatic plants, invertebrates, and fish. The proportion of lakes in the Adirondack Mountains of New York with a pH below the level of 5.0 jumped from 4 percent in 1930 to over 50 percent by 1970, resulting in the loss of fish stocks. Acid rain has also been implicated in damaging forests at elevations above two thousand feet. The northeastern United States and eastern Canada, located downwind from large industrialized areas, were particularly hard hit.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_053">Clive Ponting, <em class="emphasis">A Green History of the World</em> (New York: Penguin Books, 1991), 367.</span> Rain in the eastern United States is now about ten times more acidic than natural precipitation. Similar problems occurred in Scandinavia, the destination of Europe’s microscopic pollutants.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s02_p19">A 1983 report by a congressional task force concluded that the primary cause of acid rain destroying freshwater in the northeastern United States was probably pollution from industrial stacks to the south and west. The National Academy of Sciences followed with a report asserting that by reducing sulfur oxide emissions from coal-burning power plants in the eastern United States, acid rain in the northeastern part of the country and southern Canada could be curbed. However, the Reagan administration declined to act, straining relations with Canada, especially during the 1988 visit of Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_054">Walter A. Rosenbaum, <em class="emphasis">Environmental Politics and Policy</em>, 2nd ed. (Washington, DC: Congressional Quarterly Press, 1991), 184.</span> Acid rain was finally addressed in part by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s02_p20">The CAA, a centerpiece of the environmental legislation enacted during what might be called the first environmental wave, was significantly amended in 1990 to address acid rain, ozone depletion, and the contribution of one state’s pollution to states downwind. The act included a groundbreaking clause allowing the trading of pollution permits for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants in the East and Midwest. Plants now had market incentives to reduce their pollution emissions. They could sell credits, transformed into permits, on the Chicago Board of Trade. A company’s effort to go beyond compliance enabled it to earn an asset that could be sold to firms that did not meet the standards. Companies were thus enticed to protect the environment as a way to increase profits, a mechanism considered by many to be a major advance in the design of environmental protection.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s02_p21">This policy innovation marked the beginning of market-oriented mechanisms to solve pollution problems. The Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) expanded the scope of the original trading program and was reinstated after various judicial challenges to its method. The question of whether direct taxes or market solutions are best continues to be debated, however. With President Obama’s election in 2008, the question of federal carbon taxes in the United States versus allowing regional and national carbon markets to evolve became a hot topic for national debate.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s02_p22">Another problem that reached global proportions was ozone depletion. In 1974, chemists Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina announced that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were lowering the average concentration of ozone in the stratosphere, a layer that blocks much of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays before they reach the earth. Over time, less protection from ultraviolet rays will lead to higher rates of skin cancer and cataracts in humans as well as crop damage and harm to certain species of marine life. By 1985, scientists had observed a 50 percent reduction of the ozone in the upper stratosphere over Antarctica in the spring and early summer, creating a seasonal ozone hole. In 1988, a similar but less severe phenomenon was observed over the North Pole. Sensing disaster, Rowland and Molina called for an immediate ban of CFCs in spray cans.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s02_p23">Such a global-scale problem required a global solution. In 1987, representatives from thirty-six nations met in Montreal and developed a treaty known as the Montreal Protocol. Participating nations agreed to cut emissions of CFCs by about 35 percent between 1989 and 2000. This treaty was later expanded and strengthened in Copenhagen in 1992.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_055">Tyler Miller Jr., <em class="emphasis">Living in the Environment: Principles, Connections, and Solutions</em>, 9th ed. (Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 1996), 317–27.</span> The amount of ozone-depleting substances close to Earth’s surface consequently declined, whereas the amount in the upper atmosphere remained high. The persistence of such chemicals means it may take decades for the ozone layer to return to the density it had before 1980. The good news was that the rate of new destruction approached zero by 2006.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_056">World Meteorological Organization, <em class="emphasis">Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion: 2006</em>, Global Ozone Research and Monitoring Project—Report No. 50 (Geneva, Switzerland: World Meteorological Organization, 2007), accessed November 29, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wmo.ch/pages/prog/arep/gaw/ozone_2006/ozone_asst_report.html">http://www.wmo.ch/pages/prog/arep/gaw/ozone_2006/ozone_asst_report.html</a>.</span> It is interesting to note that businesses opposed restrictions on CFC use until patent-protected alternative materials were available to substitute for CFCs in the market.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s02_p24">The increasingly global scale of environmental threats and the growing awareness among nations of the interrelated nature of economic development and stable functioning of natural systems led the United Nations to establish the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) in 1983. The commission was convened the following year, led by chairwoman Gro Harlem Brundtland, former prime minister of Norway.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Pollution Prevention</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s03_p01">By the mid-1970s, companies had begun to act to prevent pollution rather than just mitigate the wastes already produced. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Pollution prevention</a><span class="glossdef">A method to reduce the generation of waste and other by-products in the first place so that they cannot accumulate in the environment. Typical techniques include dramatic improvements in the efficiency of production.</span></span> refers to actions inside a company and is called an in-the-pipe as opposed to an end-of-the-pipe method for environmental protection. Unlike pollution control, which only imposes costs, pollution prevention offers an opportunity for a company to save money and implement environmental protection simultaneously. Still used today, companies often enter this process tentatively, looking for quick payback. Over time it has been shown they can achieve significant positive financial and environmental results. When this happens it helps open minds within companies to the potential of environmentally sound process redesign or reengineering that contributes both ecological and health benefits as well as the bottom line of profitability.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s03_p02">There are four main categories of pollution prevention: good housekeeping, materials substitution, manufacturing modifications, and resource recovery. The objective of good housekeeping is for companies to operate their machinery and production systems as efficiently as possible. This requires an understanding and monitoring of material flows, impacts, and the sources and volume of wastes. Good housekeeping is a management issue that ensures preventable material losses are not occurring and all resources are used efficiently. Materials substitution seeks to identify and eliminate the sources of hazardous and toxic wastes such as heavy metals, volatile organic compounds, chlorofluorocarbons, and carcinogens. By substituting more environmentally friendly alternatives or reducing the amount of undesirable substances used and emitted, a company can bypass the need for expensive end-of-the-pipe treatments. Manufacturing modifications involve process changes to simplify production technologies, introduce closed-loop processing, and reduce water and energy use. These steps can significantly lower emissions and reduce costs. Finally, resource recovery captures waste materials and seeks to reuse them in the same process, as inputs for another process within the production system, or as inputs for processes in other production systems.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_057">Stephan Schmidheiny, with the Business Council for Sustainable Development, <em class="emphasis">Changing Course</em> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1992), 101–4.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s03_p03">One of the earliest instances of pollution prevention in practice was 3M’s Pollution Prevention Pays (3P) program, established in 1975. The program achieved savings of over half a billion dollars in capital and operating costs while eliminating 600,000 pounds of effluents, air emissions, and solid waste. This program continued to evolve within 3M and became integrated into incentive systems, rewarding employees for identifying and eliminating unnecessary waste.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_058">Joseph Fiksel, “Conceptual Principles of DFE,” in <em class="emphasis">Design for Environment: Creating Eco-Efficient Products and Processes</em>, ed. Joseph Fiksel (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1996), 53.</span> Other companies, while not pursuing environmental objectives per se, have found that total quality management (TQM) programs can help achieve cost savings and resource efficiencies consistent with pollution prevention objectives through conscious efforts to reduce inputs and waste generation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s02_s03_p04">Though pollution prevention is a significant first step in corporate environmental protection, Joseph Fiksel identifies several limitations to pollution prevention as typically practiced. First, it only incrementally refines and improves existing processes. Second, it tends to focus on singular measures of improvement, such as waste volume reduction, rather than on adopting a systems view of environmental performance. Renowned systems analyst Donella Meadows offered a simple definition of a system as “any set of interconnected elements.” A systems view emphasizes connections and relationships.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_059">Donella H.

Romm, <em class="emphasis">Lean and Clean Management</em> (New York: Kodansha, 1994), 33.</span> Third, as most of the gains are often in processes that were not previously optimized for efficiency, the improvements are not repeatable. Fourth, pollution prevention is detached from a company’s business strategy and is performed on a piecemeal basis.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_060">Joseph Fiksel, “Conceptual Principles of DFE,” in <em class="emphasis">Design for Environment: Creating Eco-Efficient Products and Processes</em>, ed.

Hoffman, <em class="emphasis">From Heresy to Dogma: An Institutional History of Corporate Environmentalism</em> (San Francisco: New Lexington Press, 1997), 121–22.</span> By the early 1990s, the chemical and energy industries were becoming increasingly proactive on environmental matters, looking beyond regulatory compliance toward crafting a specific environmental management strategy. The nature of government regulation began to change as well, with increasing emphasis on goals rather than technology-forcing to achieve those goals (e.g., the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990). This allowed industry more flexibility in selecting approaches to emissions reductions that made financial sense.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s03_p04">Improved regulatory design focused on goals and results rather than means and proscribed technical fixes, representing what many viewed as a positive policy strategy evolution. This adaptation by government occurred in part as a response to industry resistance to government imposition of “command and control” requirements. Often neglected in polarized discussions that simplistically frame business against government is the fact that governments are steadily adjusting, updating, and refining regulatory approaches to better reflect new knowledge, technology, and business realities. It should be kept in mind that the history of environmental and sustainability issues in business is an evolutionary process of constantly interacting and interdependent cross-sector participants that may collide but ultimately adapt and change. Just as the regulatory bodies have had to adapt to changing and emerging resource, waste stream, Earth system, and health problems, so too have environmental groups and companies had to acknowledge a novel cascade of problems associated with industrial production. Shifting, give-and-take, back-and-forth dynamics characterized the terrain even as new participants emerged. Examples of this evolution were the rising numbers of health, equity, energy, and environmental nongovernmental activist organizations, many of which had lost faith in governments’ capacities to solve problems. However, pressures on government by such groups might cause a regulatory response that creates an unintended new pollution problem. For example, does a focus on reducing large particulate matter in the air from vehicle emissions drive higher emissions of microsized particles that create a new set of medical challenges and respiratory afflictions? In addition, the environmental community is not monolithic. These organizations range from law-defying extreme activists attacking corporations to pragmatic, collaborative science-based nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) working closely with companies to generate solutions. Despite this rich evolutionary adaptive phenomenon across sectors, for the most part companies remained relatively resistant to environmental groups through the 1990s.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s03_p05">Compliance was still the primary goal, and companies combining forces to set industry standards became a method of forestalling regulation. Unless they were singled out due to their industry’s visibility or poor reputation, most companies continued to see health and environmental issues as a burden and additional cost. Environmentalism was associated with tree-huggers, altruists, overhead cost burdens, and public sector fines and regulation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s03_p06">As if on a parallel yet nonintersecting path, in 1989, a special issue of the <em class="emphasis">Scientific American</em> journal articulated the state of scientific understanding of the growing global collision and the urgency of addressing the clashes among human economic growth patterns, ecological limits, and population growth.

    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s03_p08">While there may have been less activity in the United States at the time, a new era was under way internationally. Creation of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) marked a turning point in global business engagement. In preparation for the Rio Earth Summit, Swiss industrialist Stephan Schmidheiny organized the WBCSD in 1990. The council featured over fifty business leaders from around the world. Their task was without precedent, as Schmidheiny explained: “This is the first time that an important group of business leaders has looked at these environmental issues from a global perspective and reached major agreements on the need for an integrated approach in confronting the challenges of economic development and the environment.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_068">Stephan Schmidheiny, with the Business Council for Sustainable Development, <em class="emphasis">Changing Course</em> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1992), xxi.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s03_p09">The WBCSD published a book in 1992 titled <em class="emphasis">Changing Course</em>, in which the objectives of business and the environment were argued to be compatible. Schmidheiny wrote that business must “devise strategies to maximize added value while minimizing resource and energy use,” and that “given the large technological and productive capacity of business, any progress toward sustainable development requires its active leadership.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_069">Stephan Schmidheiny, with the Business Council for Sustainable Development, <em class="emphasis">Changing Course</em> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1992), 9.</span> This language represented a mainstreaming of what is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">eco-efficiency</a><span class="glossdef">A conceptual framework that seeks to reduce the amount of material and energy needed to manufacture and use products over the product life cycle, thus minimizing waste and costs while boosting profits.</span></span> in business. The WBCSD opened new doors. Its work signaled acceptance of the new term <em class="emphasis">sustainable business</em> and hinted at <em class="emphasis">sustainability</em> as a term that referred to an alternative economic growth pattern. Sustainable business, defined as improving the efficiency of resource use, was beginning to be recognized by global business leaders as an activity in which corporations could legitimately engage. The important shift under way was that the notion of sustainability was moving from small pockets of visionary business leaders and development specialists to the broader international business community.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s03_p10">It made sense. World population growth trajectories predicted emerging economies growing at an accelerating rate. Their societies’ legitimate aspirations to live according to Western developed economies’ standards would require a tremendous acceleration in the throughput of raw materials, massive growth in industrial activity, and unprecedented demand for energy.

    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s03_p11">Of no small significance, certain publications emerged and within a few years were read widely by those interested in the debates over economic growth and population trajectories. In 1993, Paul Hawken authored <em class="emphasis">The Ecology of Commerce</em>, which brought to the public’s attention an alternative model of commerce without waste that relies on renewable energy sources, eliminates toxins, and thrives on biodiversity. Hawken moved beyond the WBCSD goals of minimization (eco-efficiency) by suggesting a restorative economy “that is so intelligently designed and constructed that it mimics nature at every step, a symbiosis of company and customer and ecology.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-larson-fn01_070">Paul Hawken, <em class="emphasis">The Ecology of Commerce</em> (New York: Harper Business, 1993), 12, 15.</span> Written for a broad audience, Hawken’s book became a must-read for those trying to grasp the tensions among economic growth, the viability of natural systems, and the possibilities for change.

    <p class="para editable block" id="larson-ch01_s03_p13">Even as the relationship among conventional business perspectives and environmental, health, and social issues shifted, albeit slowly, global problems continued to mount. Climate change debate moved from exclusively scientific conversations to mainstream media outlets.
